@DrTedros in his regular media briefing today stated that #WHO is deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, &amp; by the alarming levels of inaction. WHO therefore have made the assessment that 
#COVID19 can be characterized as a #pandemic
I can't stop thinking about the raging boners all these remote meeting app data miners are probably having knowing that everyone will need to #telecummute in the next six to nine weeks due to #COVID19
Self-serving gaslighting continues.
@realDonaldTrump has been wilfully preventing containment/mitigation of #COVID19 w/his secret mtgs, lies, shutting down early testing, delaying tests, hiding facts/truth 2 serve self since January!

I suspect the real reason  @realDonaldTrump first denies, then conspires against things like the #COVID19 Pandemic &amp; #ClimateChange, is he simply can't bear anything attracting more attention, being more important or more indispensable than he thinks he is to a worshipping world.

@Celia63927361 Oh, in 2 weeks we'll be screwed even if we start doing everything perfectly right now - given the ridiculously low volume of testing, there are *at least* 10x more cases than reported.

As we know from Wuhan, containment of #covid19 is much harder when the response is delayed.

Honestly, if this whole humanitarian angle isn't enough, there's a selfish one too:

We're probably not gonna die from #COVID19 but like...
Deadly or not, because the symptoms still really suck.
So just...Why wouldn't you want to take precautions in any case https://t.co/0UC8jiEDXq
I'll grant that Trump (after some missteps) is doing his best to fight #COVID19, but this is where the 4 years of angry tweeting and leadership by chaos hurt the country. We need a leader we can trust in crisis&amp;Trump hasn't even tried to earn that trust.

Only 3.4% of people infected by #coronavirus die, it's really not as big of a deal as the media portrays it to be. #COVID19
‚Äú(#COVID19) is coming at an exponential speed: gradually, and then suddenly...The only way to prevent this is social distancing today. Not tomorrow. Today. That means keeping as many people home as possible, starting now.‚Äù https://t.co/R2exU0YuTp @tomaspueyo @Medium
What our governments lack in speed to come up with the right responses to an exponentially growing crisis, they more than make up for by failing to implement those same half measures and compromises. #COVID19 #coronavirus #coronadeutschland

@Ilona_Kus @lemdfde @MaxCRoser @_HannahRitchie @EOrtizOspina I fear the same. Trump is doing too little too late.  Globally, we need to approach #COVID19 as a pandemic rather than waving it away as though it were nothing but a common cold.

We just don't have the proper tests for it, nor enough to go around.

Checkout #SpoonieChat today if u wanna see how #covid19 affects those of us with chronic illness, invisible illness, disabilities, mental illness. It isn't the sort of 'underlying health conditions' they talk about in the news like heart disease and such that get more visibility.
Read a lot (maybe too much) about the spreading #COVID19 pandemic tonight and last few days/weeks. Will be interesting too see if European spread or Asian effective containment wins the day in North America. Would really like to see separate testing centres in NB @Gov_NB

I‚Äôm unsure how #COVID19 goes away for a very long time/without a cure. Even if the US went into lockdown and stopped rapid spread, it wouldn‚Äôt eradicate the virus. And, it‚Äôs a global pandemic so would continually re-emerge in our country and start the process all over.
and Whomever gets the #Patent for the #covid19 illness #remedy #inoculation #cure - will make billions upon billions, I think they already have it RTG, they need to make panic worldwide and let people die before they release this. Oh yeah it's about the money, not people....

The US federal gov communications and response to #COVID19 is a case study in mass cognitive dissonance.

@AKL_Airport I think that you should be more active in asking where people have come from. I know of some people who came from UK, through SIN then SYD but was allowed to use e-gate because their boarding pass said "SYD". I don't think you're doing enough to stop #Covid_19 entry

Also understand, that this #COVID19 isn't a localized problem... It's happening  world wide... If we're overwhelmed here, we won't be getting the same help from the west (not China) like we usually do, in some major typhoon. They too are battling their own pockets of outbreak...

@KatieHill4CA Hard to read your intent here. Genuinely interested or snark directed towards the WH?  LA times ran story this morning about airlines making huge cuts. That stuff always rolls downhill, so on top of #COVID19, there will be lots of ppl at the hourly level facing earnings loss.
I want people to not feel panicked by push for social distancing. Most people will be fine. Think of it more as being a good citizen &amp; a way of helping. The point of social distancing isn‚Äôt because everyone is going to die from #Covid19. 1/

Since today's Conservative/Republican govts sympathies often lie with the wealthy and business corporations, it's unfortunate that so many of us must be governed by them during #COVID19, because a lot of them out of touch with the realities of everyday people.
Best thing I did for my own personal #anxiety about #COVID19, conference cancellations, switching to online delivery was getting offline for a bit and going for a quick run.
1200 people in the United States are infected with #COVID19 only approximately 10,000 have been tested. Anyone being flippant about this like #talkradio #FoxNews are ignoring a major health crisis.  The exponential growth of those with this disease has not reached its peak.

My father firmly believes the #COVID19 illness is manufactured hysteria from "the media". I feel so shocked and sad. All my life he has been an engineer, with great analytical skills. Maybe chemo brain??? I couldn't budge him. Devastated. :(
Simply Frightening.  The declines make my heart hurt for all American farmers.  They have been through much the last few years: trade wars, droughts, floods, fires. And now #COVID19 .

#COVID19 is literally a glorified common cold with less than .1% mortality rate. People really aren't capable of thinking for themselves. Just gotta swallow up what the media tells them. Just a bunch of sheep.
@Colorado Objection! Do not visit @Colorado the state with the 9th highest number of #Covid_19 cases. STAY HOME and avoid travel. If you must come to @Colorado WEAR A MASK.

1. You have sold stocks over the #coronavirus
2. You have advocated for school/work closings due to genuine fear of #COVID19 
3. You are scared and not also elderly or a person with a compromised immune system during the #CoronavirusOutbreak
Hi @Pontifex, can you please tell people to skip mass as we‚Äôre trying to get #COVID19 under control? Worried about my grandma, and lots of other stubborn older people during lent.
"Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death"-@DrTedros #COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdate https://t.co/O69gT3fKRY
People are saying that #COVID19 is being blown out of proportion. THOUSANDS of people are dying. THOUSANDS. And you think it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot a big deal‚Äù? THAT IS DISGUSTING. Be better humans.
WHO classifies #COVID19 a pandemic. The UK government hasn't got a plan, just carry on as normal. Hungary have taken the correct action and they have fewer cases. #JohnsonCrisis

Please do not hoard. Remember, the more you get the less is left for the other person. Be conscious of that. #COVID19
After this #COVID19 thing is all over, people will bark about how the worry and "social distancing" was mostly pointless because nothing major happened.

You know, like what some people say about vaccines.
Looking for honest feedback. Does anyone know there is a virus thing going around? It creates flu-like symptoms and if you catch it, you feel sick, I think. Is anyone at all aware of this?? #curious #CoronaVirusUpdate #COVID19 #pandemic #fear

No one personally needs a #COVID19 test.  Knowing you have it or not won't change being sick &amp; and you may be out of pocket $3k. Be safe, use precautions &amp; social distancing.  Health departments/hospitals need them and if they want to test you, let them pay for it.  #Inners
That the White House is still actively sabotaging our response to #COVID19, and the Republicans still blocking emergency sick pay and CDC funding while we are experiencing an actual #pandemic is beyond unconscionable.

To hypochondriacs worrying about #COVID19 right now.
1. Yes it's serious
2. Yes, you're going to be fine
The last 8 days of US #covid19 testing, compared to Italy's cases starting on 2/22 show a similar trajectory.

Right now all of Italy is in lockdown. If you‚Äôre in the US, please take this seriously and prepare (but don‚Äôt panic).

Am I personally scared of #COVID19 ? No. But am I going to try everything I can to protect myself and prevent the spread? Yes. Because while I would probably be ok, there are a lot of people who wouldn't be.
Where is @GordonRamsay or @jontaffer to "SHUT IT DOWN!" but for the entire planet? Can we just stop the panic already? #COVID19 #StopThePanic
Terrifying. The world may already be in recession, and it starts from March 2020. It may start from travel, then spreading to other multiple industries. What is worse, it may only be the beginning.

Serious question: At what point should a person be tested for #COVID19. Some symptoms mirror colds. We don‚Äôt want to take over resources but tracking is important. Anyone know the answer? #pandemic #Corona
they are having to choose between intubating a 40-year-old with two kids, a 40-year old who is fit and healthy with no co-morbidities, and a 60-year-old with high blood pressure, because they don't have enough beds. #COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdate  https://t.co/ogiyCUtE8A
Everyone keeps posting that meme saying #COVID19 is an introverts dream. NO. As an introvert, I like to have the choice of alone time, so I can recharge &amp; engage w/ folks. An unplanned quarantine in my home is not bonus self-care time, it‚Äôs the opposite: anxiety &amp; depression.
I‚Äôm not going to lie, friends. I am worried about my vulnerability to #COVID19. But, please know I am one stubborn motherfucker.
The #MNTwins are beginning to feel the wrath of #COVID19 and I think baseball is bound for a big shakeup soon.

I've been told that, due to #COVID19 I am not allowed to get out of my lorry except to use the toilet. NOT permitted to use the coffee machine.  So I can walk past it, to get to the toilet, but no stopping or getting a coffee.. Do the FL drivers still want me to bake em cakes?

NOTE: declaring #coronavirusoutbreak a pandemic has to do with how widely it's spreading, NOT how deadly the disease is. SARS was not labeled a #pandemic. 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu was the last one. This is the 1st pandemic caused by a #coronavirus. #COVID19 https://t.co/a5QCE4QR4Y

The PANIC virus is real too. I've done WAY too much reading on #COVID19 here's a couple thoughts. DO: if really worried, disinfect your phone as well as your hands. DON'T: panic buy. At most, a shop for 2 weeks  (and that's worse case scenario if you need to self isolate.)

Instead it is his ignorance and protecting his own interests, that lead to a 6-8 week delay in a proper response to #COVID19, that will cost 1000's of lives.

In a @KFF poll Feb 13-18, 45% of Americans were concerned (22% very concerned) they or someone in their family would get sick from #COVID19. 3 weeks later, a Quinnipiac poll found 54% concerned about people they know getting sick, tho "very concerned" remained low at 18%. 6/
Take #selfisolation seriously. Make sure your government leaders know how important it is to get a handle on this #pandemic. The @WHO has rung nearly every bell that it can about #COVID19 to warn us. Now it's our job to protect the people that we love. #FlattenTheCurve (10/10)

@SamuelAnselmo9 @species_x Because calling it ‚ÄúWuhan flu‚Äù stigmitizes the vast, vast majority of Asians who don‚Äôt have #covid19 and haven‚Äôt been exposed to it, which has led to discrimination and even violence. It eventually needed an official name, so they landed on COVID-19.
It feels like we are living in a sci-fi movie, a horror sci-fi movie. Where are millions of fckn #COVID19 tests? They are lying to us. Tests are being rationed which is absurd.
Messaging about #COVID19 needs to break things down and explain what social distancing is and isn‚Äôt, and WHY it‚Äôs important. Having tons of success educating on FB. ‚ÄúPpl don‚Äôt buy what you do; they buy why you do it.‚Äù @simonsinek #PublicHealth
@howroute @drtobbe $2000 per adult minus FEES for taxes, convenience, utility, organization, legal, transfer, etc. etc. ... that leaves each person with a total of $12.73 left to deal with #coronavirus #covid19 during #pandemic  ... damn calculator must be broken

@davidcicilline His latest tweet - asking the media for unity?  Meanwhile I am at home and can‚Äôt get tested for #COVID19 I was told by my doctor to stay home as the state health department doesn‚Äôt have enough #TheTruthMatters #WeNeedMoreTestsNow
The #COVID19 has caused and will cause deaths. I don't know how many. I hope not that many.

Human actions arising from ignorance, bigotry, incompetence and just downright fear will cause unnecessary deaths.
Reports that the #PremierLeague will be played behind closed doors. So in the space of 11 days, #liverpool lost unbeaten league run, out of FA Cup, out of #ChampionsLeague, and now face very real prospect of lifting premier league trophy to empty stadium #COVID19 #coronavirus

Leadership is all about managing crisis. #COVID19 is the biggest challenge any American president has faced since WW2. So far this American president has failed to show any leadership to address this crisis. Tonight's address might decide the #2020election

@SocialMediaShan Here's another silver lining: we really got hit hard during SARS even tho our culture tends to be overly prepared in risk management. So we upped it. Which has helped flatten our curve for #covid19 and we still have 0 deaths last I checked (one is on the edge tho). We don't just

Ok I‚Äôm now scared of #COVID19 I think following Italy‚Äôs example would be an excellent idea. Scared I‚Äôm going to get sick &amp; damage my kidneys, let alone my lungs... would quite like it if we can close everything for a few weeks?!
But I can do math. And I trust the experts. I'm not panicked but oh yeah, we're going to take this seriously. Not doing so is irresponsible. #COVID19
it is already pandemic! #COVID19 Keep healthy, be hydrated! Only we, can save ourselves.

As the NBA strongly considers the option of playing games in front of no fans, will be interesting to see how long before they decide to postpone games indefinitely. We are in completely unknown territory.  Scary times moving forward. #nba #COVID19 #raptors #WeTheNorth
We are not moving very quickly to tackle #CoronavirusPandemic. We are way behind.
#SocialDistancing is critically important in preventing the spread of #COVID19. Even for those who are not sick, the stress and anxiety brought on by the #CoronavirusPandemic &amp; the response measures needed to contain it can take a toll on mental health/social well being.
Did he just blame Europe for his lack of response? JFC. #Trumpdemic #COVID19 #pandemic #TrumpCrash
Honestly instead of playing without fans the NBA should just cancel a couple of games and let the players rest and get ready for the playoffs I'd rather you see healthy teams competing than worrying about not playing without fans #COVID19 #pandemic #COVID19

In #TrumpAddress tonight he STILL sees the #COVID19 threat as a xenophobic thing, targeting EUROPE this time (but not UK, who‚Äôs taking the same slow-walked response as the US): NEWS FLASH: ‚Äúthe call is coming from inside the house.‚Äù
The incessant tweeting about a demographic that can work from home and how this is the answer to #COVID19 is tiresome. Trying to capitalize on the "work from home movement" on the back of a pandemic minimizes the overall threat to world health and the economy.
That was not reassuring... that was not ‚Äòpromising‚Äô... Trump seemed sick... he was still placing blame elsewhere... and he has no plan on keeping Americans safe, as the virus is already here and spreading. #COVID19

Thank you Mr. President for your address. I stand with you and all Americans to do my part to prevent spread of #COVID19. I live in an area affected by this virus, but not worried in the least we will come through this challenge.
‚Å¶@tomhanks‚Å© feel better, my friend (I know we‚Äôre not but feels like we could be). Thanks for modeling how to stay level-headed and what to do if tested positive for #COVID19  https://t.co/qQnyvU6GGI
@BBCBreaking He‚Äôs going to want to build a wall in the Atlantic next...moronic move...it‚Äôs here and spreading fast coz they wasted so much time ignoring the experts and science, not testing, and insisting it‚Äôs a hoax #COVID19 #coronavirus

You are right @realDonaldTrump let‚Äôs put party lines aside to make sure all Americans are healthy. How about passing #MedicareForAll legislations so we can protect our most vulnerable? #COVID19 #CoronavirusOutbreak #CoronavirusPandemic #HealthCareForAll
@pjpaton @mahya_saber @HeshmatAlavi @MostafaMe4 @m_mrezamm @klonokid @FlorenceIran @Masoud_Dalvand2 The people in #iran are losing their lives in large scale due to the regime‚Äôs mismanagement of #COVID19. Whether or not this is an act,  why would the regime arrested her for showing concern? 
We should be concerned about the regime getting closer to the nuclear bomb!
.@CNN thinking somebody else wrote the speech and it sounds a bit xenophobic... ya think?!? #CoronavirusPandemic
If you think #COVID19 isn't a big deal, you're dead wrong. No government shuts down the country (Italy, Denmark, etc) or ceases all travel and goods from other countries. This is detrimental to the economic stability of these nations and it's obviously much worse than we thought.
who declaring coronavirus a pandemic reminded me of something and so i decided to take a look at the leaderboard for pandemic ii. nyek. here's to praying we all have the resistance and immunity that madagascar has in this game.

Stop saying China like it's a Hogwarts spell to ward off negative press. This is a GLOBAL pandemic.
Not only do we need to set aside American partisanship, we need to unite as a planet to eradicate this pestilence.
#COVID19 #pandemic
So Trump‚Äôs answer to the #CoronavirusOutbreak is to issue a travel ban against Europe except the U.K. Xenophobia is the real epidemic that must be eradicated.
I refuse to listen to anything @realDonaldTrump says about #COVID19 because he's going to say what makes him look good rather than the truth. He dismantled an agency to prepare us for this kind of pandemic because he is short sighted. Figure he'll lie 2 the people 4 the markets.

Donald Trump has banned travel from Europe to the United States for 30 days from midnight on Friday. The ban excludes the UK. In South Africa, we're told "not to panic but to remain calm" yet most confirmed cases had recently visited Europe. #CoronavirusInSA #CoronavirusOutbreak
Travel Ban will not solve the problem. This President has no plans to save Americans. The virus is here and spreading fast . Stopping the flights will not stop it. What the Fuck!? #COVID19

The president referred to #COVID19 as a ‚Äúforeign virus‚Äù. 

Could we not turn to xenophobia maybe once in this administration?

Could we maybe not blame foreigners for all our problems and actually solve the problem? 

Is that something we could do?
Thank you, @realDonaldTrump for working so hard on these crucial solutions to solve the #CoronavirusPandemic issue.

Shutting down travel from Europe is NECESSARY.

Offering economic assistance to our businesses is VITAL.

The President is putting America First!

Trumps speech
- Travel ban on Europe
- Emergency financial relief to be passed by Congress despite the fact that Repubs blocked workers relief bill today
- Payroll tax reduction but only helps if you‚Äôre getting paid
- Didn‚Äôt address severity of the threat or testing #COVID19
@JackPosobiec I don't fear the Chinese #CoronavirusOutbreak I do fear the communist vermin Chinese government withholding crucial medications that we rely upon...#WuhanVirus #WuhanCoronavirus #WuhanFlu #ChineseCoronavirus #pandemic
Tom and Rita Wilson have #COVID19 
I blame Trump. #ETTD
America, he's trying to distract us. South Korea can test up to 60,000 people a day. We have tested no more than 5,000 people throughout this nation. The Trump Administration has been a complete failure with this #CoronavirusPandemic and we need to hold him to account.
I miss when I worried about the Democratic establishment coordinating to destroy the progressive wing of the party. 

I miss when I worried about some rich family renaming my school. 

Now I get to worry that an inept #potus is going to cause mass hysteria and death #COVID19
Folks, if you have a cough, stay home. People will freak out with you coughing around them. Even if you aren't really sick, stay the heck out of the public spaces. Or at least use a damn cough lozenge. 

#CoronavirusOutbreak
@GregLeding Yes, that's what I was thinking. I don't know what it takes to make a special session happen, but I would think that #COVID19  would qualify if anything does. Too many places have waited too late, the time to act is now not when we're in full tilt emergency.
Well, @realDonaldTrump just made every Shipboard IDC‚Äôs job everywhere exponentially harder tomorrow with that single address to the Nation...ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò≠‚öìÔ∏è #SailorsWillBeUAtomorrow #COVID19 #ShipboardIDCLife
On another note, if governments had reacted early and shut everything down the media would have accused them of overreacting and spreading panic, just as they‚Äôve accused them of downplaying the risks now. Taking opposing side in order to spread panic. #COVID19
Well, after the #TrumpAddress I can't say that I feel more confident about US response to #COVID19. Why must Trump deny the reality of the situation and play up the economic strength. I feel people are worried about their health more than the Dow Jones.
Epic fail - Trump's Oval Office public service announcement was meant to reassure the country that the federal gov't is ahead of the outbreak. Didn't address test shortages, rapid rise of cases, social distancing. Just don't worry. #CoronaVirusUpdate #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID19 https://t.co/ObA83WB3i1
Oh no!! Tom Hanks has the #coronavirus #COVID19
A few questions that come to mind after #POTUS #COVID19 #OvalOffice address:

- Do you feel better, safer?
- What about test kits?
- What if I‚Äôm in Europe and travel to UK, can I still come to US? 
- Do you feel like US is leading globally? In it together, or going it alone?

its here now travel ban not the issue 

what coordinated efforts are being taken to curtail the spread of #COVID19
We need test kits; medical equipment; field hospitals; rapid response protocols.  The virus is HERE NOW so travel restrictions don‚Äôt improve the current situation on the ground here.  What is wrong with you @realDonaldTrump ? #COVID19

President Trump restricts all travel from Europe for 30 days. I‚Äôm torn. As a libertarian, I‚Äôm terrified by the extreme measure and dangerous precedent, but I‚Äôm relieved about potentially curbing #COVID19. However, #publicsafety has often legally been used to do terrible things.
Today I called 80 black mothers and let them know they would receive $1000 a month for the next 12 months #MagnoliaMothersTrust. In the midst of this #COVID19 crisis I know that money will relieve a huge amount of stress. But my heart breaks still... it was a dent we need a wave.

@WalshFreedom I‚Äôm less worried about people coming over from Europe than I am about the people here that already have #COVID19.  I actually feel worse than I did before.
Was relieved to hear from my doc today that despite being #immunocompromised, there‚Äôs little reason to suspect #COVID19 would affect me much differently from the normal flu. While everyone should seek similar guidance from their own medical team, I hope this info is calming!
- practice good ‚úã hygiene
- avoid crowded gatherings
- stay home if sick 
- and hopefully we increase telemedicine triage that our emergency rooms are not overwhelmed beyond limit

If everyone is worried about the #CoronavirusPandemic that means attention is diverted from other medical issues. That‚Äôs not an accident. @glennbeck is blowing this wide open.
@realDonaldTrump  is a BOSS. His natl address was exactly what was needed to calm everybody the hell down.

Continuing the #HowNottoHandleaPandemic series, our President is gaslighting the nation &amp; it will kill people. It already has. Plus, he's either losing his mind worse than ever, or that man is sick... That would be painfully ironic. #COVID19 #coronavirus #TrumpVirus https://t.co/Nt7B6he3gt

@realDonaldTrump You've been an utter failure!!

You have no empathy for Americans or our allies! #COVID19 #TrumpNotFitForOffice
I'm having a difficult time focusing on anything other than #COVID19. Things that I usually find very important, like preparing a group meeting presentation for tmrw, feel insignificant.

Welcoming any and all tips on handling day-to-day tasks b/c my anxiety is through the roof.
The @POTUS addresses the nation about the problems in the US and how they are handling it. The buttholes on CNN were upset he didn‚Äôt show empathy for Italy. This is MY problem with the media. #COVID19
Senile old man, struggling for breath, rambles at length, points fingers of blame, announces nonsensical plans. Yup, that was reassuring. #COVID19 #coronavirus #TrumpVirus
@realDonaldTrump28 God Bless you! Good call as we informed ourselves a week and a half ago, canceling our trip to Ireland and Italy scheduled for 3/28. The thought of being held in Europe and not able to return home was enough. Praying for our dear friends in Milan! #COVID19

People seem to have either a false sense of security or a false sense of hopelessness about #COVID19. Yet there are a clear set of concrete measures that we can and should be taking right now to drastically reduce the harm.
@mitchellreports Poor leadership next @realDonaldTrump will blame Obama &amp; Hillary Clinton the president is so out touch &amp; Leadership is needed!! Bush had 911 &amp; Obama had economy &amp; now se have #CoronavirusPandemic without leadership in the White House!
If that was supposed to be reassuring, we are way more screwed than I originally thought. #COVID19
Someone want to tell me why we, as a country, are okay with a President that is blatantly using an OOA about #COVID19 to promote his platform during election year. It's already here, it's already out of control, and we aren't prepared to handle it.
#WorstPresidentInHistory
Right now we may have shut down air travel to Europe but we have a massive open southern border.

I have not been panicky, but that's it, @JustinTrudeau, restriction on the Canada-US border and flights must go on immediately. Like now.

I don‚Äôt mean sound dramatic, but I would f*cking loose my grip on reality if anything bad happens to Tom Hanks. I wish both he and Rita Wilson a speedy recovery. #CoronavirusOutbreak
@realDonaldTrump Your address was inadequate and lacking leadership. It should have focused on testing and not travel bans! #COVID19 is here! #WhereAreTheTests #Trumpdemic #TrumpVirus #CoronavirusOutbreak  #NotMyPresident
If you want confidence that our government is working to address the spread and treatment of #COVID19, don't watch Trump's address. No confidence to be had there.

The only reason Trump even acknowledged #COVID19 is because the stock market is taking a POUNDING from the Coronavirus. It's killing his main selling point for re-election (the economy). Trump doesn't give a shit about PEOPLE who come down with (and die from) this disease.

For the record, I could give TWO F*CKS about @TomHanks and his wife getting the #coronavirus! They are very wealthy, they will be just fine! It's the poor and the elderly who don't have the financial resources #TomHanks has that I'm worried about! #CoronavirusOutbreak

#CoronavirusPandemic is breaking my heart. My Gma‚Äôs nursing home suspended family visitation to protect the residents‚Äîincredibly important measure, yet so emotionally tough for families who visit daily/weekly.  Not knowing how long this could last, is it safer to bring them home?
@seanreycraft I guess that they're going to just shut down everything to be safe. And I have to say that I feel sorry for all businesses losing business when the #COVID19 is unrelated.

So, this is an extreme and xenophobic response that is totally futile.  It won‚Äôt save lives, it won‚Äôt prevent spread of the disease, and will crush the global economy even more. Plus it will further isolate the US from our allies. Lunacy. #COVID19 #EuropeTravelBan

None were over 50. But what if they became carriers, with light symptoms, and passed #COVID19 to their older relatives, coworkers or fellow commuters?
The markets did NOT like that Presidential announcement. Up 2% to down 2.4%. Travel bans from Europe are necessary but defintely alarming for investors. I hope #COVID19 is contained quickly but it really doesn't seem like that will be the case. #bearmarket
First, Trump does a confused #TrumpAddress full of puffery, shifted blame, and flagrant untruths, announcing a pointless European travel ban... sans the UK, for reasons?

Nah but fr this #CoronavirusOutbreak reminds me of the pandemic games they aren't closing down traveling yet
P.S. I had full body sweat, chills and dizziness today, but feel better after a nap. My first of 8,000 likely paranoid delusions that I might have #COVID19 before many of us actually do get it.
NOT TOM HANKS. I remember my husband and I listening to his Oscar speech and saying that we wish he could be our president. Nooooooo!!! #TomHanks #castaway #CoronaOutbreak #COVID19 #canceleeverything
And tonight, as I scroll through Twitter &amp; process (as best I can) everything around #coronavirus #Covid_19, these words sounded in my head so clearly: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to die. I want to live.‚Äù Now, I‚Äôm not in panic mode, despite we‚Äôre facing a pandemic. I‚Äôm rather calm, really. 3/

Soviet-style circular BS: bc of arrogance/incompetence of a White House that got rid of its global pandemic team for ideological reasons &amp; downplayed crisis, we were woefully unready to test for #COVID19. W/few tests now avail,Trump cites modest # of positive tests as reassurance
The #COVID19 testing criteria are frightening. I had to spend &gt;2 hours on the phone to discuss my recommendation for testing a confirmed case‚Äôs ‚Äúcontact‚Äôs contact‚Äù who is symptomatic, only to be told they don‚Äôt quality for testing. I‚Äôm afraid #communityspread is among us
Reactivity is not proactivity. When everyone starts to flee, will their temps be checked and tests perfromed at all points of entry into the country?

I could really do without folks saying there‚Äôs no reason to worry about #COVID19. Especially when they live in rural parts of the state and have no trouble keeping away from people. #NYC is a unique beast. And yes, it‚Äôs scary.
So my school has shut down due to the #CoronavirusPandemic I would‚Äôve thought everyone would go home or stay in their rooms and not go out. This is a conversation I heard in the bathroom. No I‚Äôve heard more and more conversations all of sudden about going out. Be safe people!!
@RottenInDenmark Worse, there are many of us  ill for the last 11-14 days with pneumonia and respiratory symptoms and *unknown flu type virus,  BUT #CDCgov restrictions did not allow me to be tested for #COVID19. So, I'm on day 14  with respiratory illness and will get a huge bill even w/ ins.

@OReasonStands @realDonaldTrump That message was horrible. His slurred words, wheezing, stumbling to read the teleprompter was so bad.

Did Trump even mention the people that have died? Or are in critical care and are currently infected? All he did was blame Europe (except the UK), shut down travel and offer up some financial stimulus. No mention of accelerating testing. #USPolitics #CoronaVirus #COVID19

@DrBradyMcMurray @realDonaldTrump Sorry no. According to the #COVID19 taskforce led by @VP this delay in testing was because  we made our own tests, which initially had errors. Again, he promised 1

@Catapultkid @McFaul @TheWarMonitor Social distancing is the one proven means to address a pandemic. I did not hear much about this approach.  #COVID19 spreads from people who are not sick so you cannot really know who is a carrier.
Tom Hanks saved Private Ryan but couldn't avoid #COVID19. Rudy Gobert won Defender of the Year but couldn't defend himself from #coronavirus.

But sure, blame foreigners+Europe and overlook taking action to mitigate the spread and severity of the pandemic domestically.

#COVID19 is a pandemic ‚Äî a worldwide problem. The #coronavirus is in the U.S. and spreading in our communities. We don‚Äôt know the full extent because we have failed to test. That lack of information is a far bigger problem than European travel.

Trump bans air travel from Europe? Australia should ban air travel from America. All our recent cases have come from the US because they are not testing. #CoronaOutbreak #COVID19 #auspol #coronavirus #corinavirusaus @realDonaldTrump
@artcollisions There's no recommendations to avoid small groups. We need our friends, and we also need to carry handcream for our dry skin after all our handwashing! I'm carrying soap with me.
The situation is changing day by day. But, clearly the USA has hugely under-sampled for #COVID19.
Still have people on your social media saying they had the flu once and everyone needs to calm down, and this is all the media‚Äôs fault? Take care of yourselves. Wash your hands,
clean your phones, stop shaking hands. Let‚Äôs slow this thing down; whatever means necessary. #COVID19 https://t.co/T7wVI2K99F

The NBA is suspending the season, travel to a Europe is suspended and Tom Hanks is sick. We are living in a nightmare scenario where soon every Chuck E. Cheese in America will be closed. #COVID19

Massive quarantine is the only way to deal with Coronavirus in USA.  Every day it is delayed will cost lives.  https://t.co/I1lb2aI3k1 #Covid_19 #CoronavirusUSA #pandemic #CancelEverything #cornoravirus #NBA
This just in. The @NBA has decided to suspended the season over Coronavirus fears.

Many people: But I need to be able to socialize! I‚Äôll get lonely!

Me: Finally! Being an introvert with social anxiety pays off.

Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson have #Coronavirus. They're in #Australia, where the 63-year-old actor was set to film a movie. Sending healing vibes.  #Covid19 https://t.co/hwKAdZwL8g
@tomhanks OK...now I am really PISSED OFF!!!! How dare that damn #COVID19 virus attack Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson!!!! They are national treasures!!! I adore you both and will send healing thoughts and prayers to you! God Love and Bless you!!! Get better and hurry home!!! xx üíó üåºüòò
@CarmineSabia With the all-Leftist media, it's Heads = You Lose, Tails = We Win. It's good to let them expose themselves like they are now... Proving their hysteria before this wasn't genuine at all. Proving their desire to stop the #CoronavirusPandemic wasn't genuine at all.
That quote taught me a lot about how life works and how you should always be ready for anything.... I think the intro to the movie with the feather falling perfectly demonstrates the beauty of randomess and how it happens all around us constantly. #covid19 https://t.co/LsLzoY8QTE
@KHSD_Official Protect our kids some states banning 250 people in crowds, @NBA banning fans in arena‚Äôs, our kids at lunch are in a big crowd... we need school suspended now not till a death or positive test. @bakersfieldnow @KGETnews @23ABCNews #COVID19
That being said, Formula 1 is less than a day away from welcoming their first 2020 season race IN MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA.
I‚Äôm curious, and actually really nervous, of a potential race cancellation seeing as the whole #COVID19 situation is JUST starting to blow out of proportion.
Between Tom Hanks, the NBA, and orange moron admitting that #COVID19 is a big deal....I'm not sure how worried I should be..
but damn. Stay safe out there,  folks.

Drama everywhere. Feels like #crypto twitter but in the real world setting.
...this podcast by Joe Rogan, ft. Michael Osterholm, I truly feel, is the most rational, clear, and bluntly reassuring take on #Covid19 I have seen. This WILL be tough, this WILL be a problem, but we CAN manage it if we give the public the right info.

@Redkat5000 I'm mentally preparing myself for many #Covid_19 eventualities, but losing Hanks ain't one of them....

I may need a seat. I'm not happy with this ride, could get off.
Just this response, or lack of, to COVID-19 should be enough for America to get rid of Trump. Americans, your lives are on his hands. Vote him out. #CoronavirusPandemic
Tom Hanks  announces that he and Rita Wilson have tested positive for Covid-19 in Australia. #COVID19 #CoronaOutbreak #CoronavirusPandemic

Hello @uofg &amp; @UofG_Housing - one of the main concerns raised by our #BIOL1070 students today while we discussed #covid19 was why there was no soap in university residences.

@CNN This sucks. More importantly, these stories will very soon cease to be scary or interesting. #COVID19
Still gonna worry if the outbreak would peak (which we REALLY DONT WANT TO HAPPEN) cause we still dont have the "health care system" to provide to those who would be affected and that would be alarming. Sadly we have a poor health management in our country. Stay safe. #COVID19

If @realDonaldTrump civilization threatening handling of #Covid_19 is not sufficient to consider an urgent 25th Amendment move to save us, the government is lost and we as people are doomed.

Same here in VA. After a whole panel of tests, which can take over 24 hours to gets results from, are negative, if you still have all signs of #Covid19, you still aren't getting tested. Must have made contact with a "positive" in order to be tested. Dangerous. https://t.co/1zoas9En5s
Am so sick of ppl saying #Covid_19 #coronavirus is just a simple cold/flu. NO it is not. Read the science behind it. This is a novel (brand new) virus that can spread easily &amp; is 10x more lethal than a seasonal flu. No, ppl don't need to panic but need to be prepped #pandemic

so, what am trying to say with my RTs is that we should expect this fascist government to exploit the #COVID19 crisis and let people die. because the Moderate-controlled Congress won't fight back. they‚Äôll use a bailout or a budget appropriation for the Wall to cosplay a revolt.

*Opinion*
In times of increased anxiety, we look to our government and trust that elected officials are competent enough to handle complex issues. 

Since Jan. 2017, we have been grossly underserved by incompetence. 

#COVID19 has only exaggerated that deficit.
üó£ Y‚ÄôALL TANGERINE IN CHIEF FINNA KICK IT INTO GEAR, NOW, CUZ HIS FAMOUS FRIENDS GONNA TEST POSITIVE, TOO! OH... I forgot...he said it‚Äôs gonna disappear.üòë Nooo worries... they‚Äôre all ok! üôèüèæ#coronavirus #COVID19
Ulta is probably removing the testers in their store because of the #CoronavirusPandemic I‚Äôm shook
Trump speaks, and the country panics. This is not good. We are all in for some serious hardship. We have NO LEADERSHIP. #TrumpAddress #COVID19 #Coronavirus
Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson tested positive for #COVID19! https://t.co/95rN6e6fzs
Thank goodness he banned travel from Europe, except the UK where he owns Turnberry Golf Resort because THE VIRUS IS ALREADY HERE, and it won‚Äôt hurt his profits. #Corona #Covid19 #CoronavirusOutbreak #CoronavirusPandemic #covidcoverup
The NBA season has just been cancelled. No flights from Europe to the US. Coachella and SXSW both postponed. Tom Hanks tested + for Coronavirus... yet we are still here at the Capitol putting toilet paper over microphones during public testimony. üò¨üò∑ #COVID19
That's it. Going out to buy puzzles and board games tomorrow.

#NBA Season postponed. @tomhanks has it. @realDonaldTrump suspends travel to and from Europe. All in the last hour. We are just at the tip of the iceberg with this #CoronavirusPandemic here in the United States. Stay safe and healthy, friends. it's gonna be a rough few months.
Whenever I go to tweet, the empty box prompts me with "What's happening?" and honestly it's starting to feel like that's all that's really worth tweeting anyway.

In the last 5 mins the @NBA has been suspended , Tom hanks got the virus and @POTUS just canceled all flight from Europe to the USA . 
Yet the cheltenham festival still went ahead . Genuine madness really #COVID19
@maddow serious question: #COVID19 v. flu: how to square zero disruptions, business as usual, no crowd control, no public service announcements, no travel bans, no accelerated testing nonchalance which routinely let‚Äôs 20,000 to 52,000 folks die, quietly, from the flu every year?
2 hours ago: Trump isn't serious about #CoronavirusPandemic! This is life &amp; death. Our lives are at risk! Oh the humanity!

45 minutes ago: Trump is stopping #Coronavirus. That's racist! This is ethnicity &amp; skin color. Our feels are at risk! Oh the identity!

#TrumpAddress
This day was the worst one period. #COVID19 is here now. I haven‚Äôt really worried about it until now...it‚Äôs scary now.
We need Obama to step back in now to fix this problem and get all the fools out the White House. #CoronavirusPandemic
So, seems like #Covid_19 is starting to affect a lot of people in the US now, from Tom Hanks to NBA stars, and who knows what's next. 

Please don't panic, just use the same caution of washing your hands, keeping contact to a minimum and be smart about it. Be cautious, not crazy.
I do hope trees can breathe in the #COVID19 and turn them into something not harmful üòÄ. #Fantacy https://t.co/15OqtQ59wb
There has been worse diseases/viruses than the Corona Virus that plagued the human race, we also had worse medicine practices. We gonna be alright. Panicking is just making us more weak. #COVID19
In all seriousness, I think people forget just how many in the U.S. got sick/died when swine flu was a thing. Everything with #COVID19 might seem like an overreaction (and perhaps it is to an extent), but do we really want to go through that again on a potentially worse scale?
The #media is out of #control. This #coronavirus is not that deadly but yet the media has everyone scared because they can‚Äôt stop themselves for one #ducking minute from talking about it. #Pandumbic #pandemic #CoronavirusOutbreak #BREAKING #CancelEverything

@aoifegracemoore But not the UK who have skyrocketing numbers infected which are growing by the hour, a country who is still allowing soccer matches like #LIVATL go ahead attended by thousands of Spanish supporters where its out of control, this is a silly move from Trump. #coronavirus #COVID19
I understand that a lot of people see these #COVID19 updates as panicking. But, honestly, isn‚Äôt a little bit of precaution better than naively believing we won‚Äôt be effected? Better to be safe than sorry folks. #BigPicture #CoronaVirus
Everyone who voted for Trump, everyone  who thought, ‚Äúit‚Äôll be fine what‚Äôs the worst that could happen?‚Äù Well... record national debt wasn‚Äôt enough. Children in cages wasn‚Äôt enough. Stacking the whitehouse with special interests wasn‚Äôt enough. 
#COVID19 probably won‚Äôt be either.
You‚Äôre all beautiful, worthy, strong individuals. It seems like the world is caving all around us b/c of #COVID19, the Democratic primaries, Fascism &amp; Oligarchies taming control..

But we‚Äôre stronger. We WILL survive this. I love y‚Äôall‚ù§Ô∏è Let‚Äôs keep our heads up, yeah? https://t.co/WujEWzphEC
@danielsgoldman @JohnWDean Unbelievable... #COVID19 is a pandemic... Trump is playing games, slow walking any public assistance... if he keeps this up... public pressure should be quick and serious... life / death... Pence and others could be forced into a 25th amendment option that he's unfit to serve...
Well it‚Äôs officially time to panic... when billion dollar industries such as the @NBA suspend all operations you know it‚Äôs bigger than we want it to be... good luck and god speed #COVID19
During the #TrumpAddress tonight it was only about three things.

1.This is not my fault, shifts blame to China and Europe.

2.This is not a financial crisis.

3.I want to talk about myself.

Should we panic now ? 
#CoronavirusPandemic
I see lots of #COVID19 blame being directed at Trump for not doing enough. But remember he did try to restrict travel initially, only to have WHO and the media go on rants about that being an overstep. This is no ones fault. Not even Trump's.
Trump is protecting the outside of his house from fireüî• while there is a growing üî• in the kitchen. While this is a good move with his political base (‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù are the problem!‚Äù) I fear it will do little to stop the growing epidemic within.   #Covid_19 https://t.co/tWSJtsyfmW

Well #covid19 #coronavirus is teaching us all sorts.

The #Trump Administration has done a terrible job managing the #COVID19 #coronavirus outbreak. Testing was delayed so long that random infected Americans have spread it to multiple tourists fr Canada, Guyana, and who knows where else? Shameful #incompetence from @realDonaldTrump
This person obviously didn‚Äôt listen well.  The flight suspensions are to address the spread of disease. These actions aren‚Äôt being taken with only the market in mind.  How dense is the left? Literally all they care about is hating Trump. #COVID19 https://t.co/jZkoXqbIKa

You could now consider #COVID19 #biological #terrorism on a global scale. We will never know if it was released on purpose, but it certainly has put the world in a state of fear. Just imagine if it had a higher morbidity rate. #BiologicalWarfare
Was anyone tested for #Covid_19  previously? Now everyone is getting tested.  The more you test the more positives you will get, it's simple math.  This may have been around for along time, now it's a big deal.  Test for any disease and you'll see an increase in that disease.
As hard as it is to say, expect even more drastic things then this soon. Possibly before this week is out.

Tomorrow the market will implode, inflation will skyrocket over coming weeks. We ARE now all going to die,, but because of economy, not #Covid_19!

Breaking: Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson and a player in @utahjazz have #COVID19 . NBA suspends season. Yeah, that just happened. Meanwhile, The Russian Agent‚Äîwho fired the nation‚Äôs pandemic response chain of command in 2018 (for no known reason)‚Äîspeaks like a robot in the Oval Office.

Life Pro Tip:

 If someone says:

"I'll worry about #COVID19 when it kills someone younger than 30"

Distance yourself from them. They're psychos.

Also, check in on their parents.
Just saying that if I or any of my family catch #covid19 , end up in a hospital and my insurance decides not to cover it...well they are just out of luck cuz I'm not paying for that. #M4A ....I'm getting paranoid about it.
So much for that! After waiting for the #presidentialaddress, my anxiety only remains. Maybe he was yelling at ppl prior to the address? He was hoarse &amp; only posed for re-election.  No empathy nor solutions.  Just vague promises! #CoronavirusPandemic
Hello #DataScience 
Its time to use filters. 
#COVID19 on a large scale affecting the age group between 55years +
With proper health screenings in place can use filters for travelers instead of cutting out traffic on mass scale.

PLEASE @realDonaldTrump @TeamPelosi @senatemajldr put down your arms, sit down and work through these problems. We are all Americans right now. And we are looking to you all to lead the country out of this. #COVID19
Tom &amp; Rita will be FINE! I say they will be FINE! #COVID19
For those #Republicans that still believe in #Trump after he said the #USA had the #COVID19 under control hopefully can now see what this man is about. Nobody reasonable is blaming him for the disease but he is arrogant &amp; foolish.
The kids be thinkin I‚Äôm crazy af, but now that I‚Äôve told ‚Äòem about Rudy &amp; the NBA, they‚Äôre all ears! I tested ‚Äòem yesterday on proper hand-washing techniques: they FAILED! 1 lil bitty WRONG step can lead to total contamination!
It‚Äôs gonna get worse, y‚Äôall! #coronavirus #COVID19
If @realDonaldTrump had taken the #COVID19 pandemic seriously from the start, we would not be seeing people now testing positive. Not having enough test kits available is HUGE. Now, everyday people need to have access to them, too.

#TrumpIsAnIdiot #CoronavirusPandemic I was hoping we'd get away without a major problem because I knew #Trump would screw it up. Sadly, he's proving what I've known for 30+ years - he's a fuckup, always been a fuckup. Deal with it.
@InspiringU2 NO! Getting everyone &amp; I MEAN EVERYONE tested so isolation &amp; early supportive care can be used against #COVID19.

@realDonaldTrump 11 minutes reading a teleprompter with no compassion in your voice does not give anyone hope. You are not concerned about #Americans #ItsAllAboutMe . You just told us a few days ago ‚Äústay calm, it will go away.‚Äù Good luck with that. You have been very disappointing #COVID19

@realDonaldTrump
The UK Health Minister has tested positive for #covid19 and is symptomatic. UK has #coronavirus and is ramping up testing 500%.
You didn't mention testing at all. Our testing is slow, not aggressive, insufficient to meet the challenges of the pandemic
Moments like tonight are why I remain #NeverTrump... he does not have the capacity to lead let alone understand any complex issue, especially this. In the face of #coronavirus / #Covid_19 @realDonaldTrump is a threat to the health, safety, and economy of America.

#NBAAllStar tested positive for #CoronavirusPandemic is super real shuts the #sportsbook down @NBA is right to shut it down. This will be something that will be seen by many companies as a suspension globally to suppress this #pandemic

I'm thinking about this trope I keep hearing that lists the other causes of death (vehicular trauma, seasonal flu, malaria) and suggests that we thus can and should ignore #COVID19. My first response is anger and frustration. My second response is to dig into the question.
extent--it's a part of being human in our modern culture. So why would we look at #COVID19 any differently? There are good and bad reasons to do so. Bad reasons might include our general sense of anxiety about the world &amp; our hunger for some sort of apocalypse to justify

The scientific public health evidence was all there despite many of the unknowns. For months, policy and politics were truly not responsive to the seriousness of the #Covid_19 
We enter now the emergency mode rather than the preparedness one. Flying the plane while building it.
Trump is one of the most despicable humans on the planet ..
imagine having the stones  ,the narcissistic fragility to blame European govt's for him not shutting down travel to the US 
Whatever is in store for America and it looks bad..

HIS ALONE 
#COVID19
India has taken the lead in acknowledging this much before other nations and rightly so.

India ought to be hyper sensitive to this outbreak owing to certain limitations in the health sector (scale, experience etc) and our large population.

2. India is a huge nation that thrives on business and tourism. You have no idea on the impact this has on these industries when such a step is taken by the government

Call it confidence or over confidence... This is the right thing to do.

3. We as a world are slowly moving from the stage of containment to the stage of  mitigation. I was rambling just last evening about the delay from WHO in terming this as a PANDEMIC.

It has finally happened and reiterates my point about mitigation.

If #Trump 's serious about stopping spread, exempting UK, where #Covid19's on cusp of exponential rise, is shortsighted. Is it because UK's seen as a US satellite? Or because, like #Johnson, #Trump wants to keep official case numbers low by rationing tests.https://t.co/cM2ROOXqpf

You think you have problems? #Covid_19 just went from the masculine to the feminine form in French and anyone who has to write, edit or translate for a public in that language is losing their minds. Stay strong, mes amis!

The thing is, the prescribed social distancing is not an option for our daily commuters across regions, especially the ones in Metro Manila. Our government agencies need to work on this before #COVID19 spreads like wildfire.

This is the real reason that #COVID19 is having such an impact on financial markets, regardless of the (false/naive) comparisons to the common flu/cold.

1/x Tips for coping with #Covid_19 anxiety. 1) take good self-care measures for health 2) wash hands regularly per CDC guidelines 3) limit social media use &amp; checking the news (ex: no more than 30 min a day, or check news once a day) 4) avoid ritualistic behaviors #CBTWorks

Attention everyone on https://t.co/aVW7rQmCou. with recent news about coronavirus pandemic and it‚Äôs implications on the general public, I think there is something that should go without saying but needs to be addressed:

We live in a society
#coronavirus #Covid_19
@ZachSmithGI @tberzin @AustinChiangMD @NMGastro Agreed, but maybe 2-3 months from now #Covid_19 is at a minimum and travel resumes.  Would be nice to go back to business as normal and interview in person.  I‚Äôm just trying to be optimistic.  Only time will tell.
Due to escalating concerns around #COVID19 - we have made the decision to cancel our upcoming in-person Metrics of Data Madness events in Atlanta, Chicago, Buffalo and Las Vegas. We hope you‚Äôll join us digitally instead for our live webinar on 3/16. https://t.co/DY9q4YBQvr https://t.co/26w99E8MnD
No wonder my stress and anxiety levels are OFF THE CHARTS. #COVID19 https://t.co/GMpxAivKVA

AND we others should PRESUME we are CATCHING #COVID19, without symptoms, and AVOID passing it on, especially to the above. #coronavirus #wuhanvirus
@kurteichenwald ‚ÄúThis is not a financial crisis,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúThis is just a temporary moment in time that we will overcome as a nation and a world.‚Äù 

Make sure you understand also. To Trump, our DEATH is nowhere as important as a financial crisis.

We need some clarity on the coronavirus or for it to stabilize then only demand and business confidence will return! No amount of stimulus can help in a meaningful way #COVID19
#COVID19 When we find ourselves getting into crisis , it‚Äôs human nature to think things couldn‚Äôt get any worse. Trust me , things could get a lot worse if we will not be transparent and agile . More often than not , the situation deteriorates before it gets better.

@ErinOTooleMP It is easy to close Canada‚Äôs borders like US but it will be disastrous for businesses &amp; economy. Canada‚Äôs measured approach to #COVID19 is not only protecting #Canadians  but also minimizing possible damage to economy from complete shutdown.
A few thoughts as I‚Äôm not sleeping with all the #Covid_19 business going on.

1) The #pandemic is a gift to the nationalists out there who have been looking for an excuse to make their borders thicker and blame foreigners.
to all the people who think others are "over-reacting" and "freaking out" about #covid19

i don't think you understand what being preemptive or preventive MEANS if you think shutting down schools and shit is "paranoid"

Trump still is thinking in terms of the economy rather than the health of the nation. He is in denial re #COVID19 and does not know what to do. Pence is clueless. There is NO leadership. They spend more time congratulating themselves on what a great job they are doing. NOT TRUE
This is why things are being canceled due to #COVID19 in one perfect picture. It's NOT because people are getting hysterical or because they believe the virus is so deadly they are panicking. It's because we only have so much capacity to deal with a lot of very sick people.

Hope there is an effective vaccine before wave 2 of #coronavirus because it very well could be far more deadly and effect younger people

In fact that's likely. It will probably adapt to infect younger populations.
I'd like to think that with sports stars and movie stars now diagnosed, this will get real for some of those who've been denying reality.

@EddieMikeUSA @AsheSchow This is assuming first case was 3/4. The #CoronavirusPandemic has been around since late 2019 early 2020. It now is able to to be tested for and that is the cause for panic. The rise in cases is because it is no longer a viral infection that we get all the time. It has a name.

@NitashaKaul While the loss of academic work &amp; time is really sad but I think the flight ticket part can be a consolation if what the airlines say is correct. According to them any event cancellation due to #Covid_19 is refundable but then they're just as unpredictable as the virus itself
Stay safe out there everybody. Prepare to be quarantined, maintain impeccable hygiene, and avoid crowds at all costs. #CoronavirusPandemic
@NBA proving they know nothing about health... just like @WHO. Tank your own profits, you got it! 

#CoronavirusPandemic isn‚Äôt a pandemic, it only looks like one thanks to the media.
@fitemebp The UK has higher rates than most EU countries and they are exempt from Trump's new ban. For God sake, he hasn't banned travel from South Korea, with the 2nd highest #Covid19 cases in the world. It's here. Travel bans are a distraction. He should cancel all of his rallies stat! https://t.co/KUX4lrQgmd
Many working in public health fighting #Covid19 in various ways are true heroes - long hours, risk to self, dealing with an increasingly scared population, all sorts of pressures, limited guidance, many unknowns. I thank them. And so should we all. #coronavirus
Viruses know no national borders, races or socioeconomic statuses. Prayers for those most susceptible. God Bless everyone! #CoronavirusPandemic #COVID19US

Trump's travel ban for #CoronavirusPandemic is something that needs more than 280 characters to unpack but here's one short take: USA has approx 1200 cases UK has approx 500 cases and is only the size of Louisiana yet somehow they get an exemption from the ban... #TrumpLogic
Let's face it : #Covid_19 is everywhere and we don't know the full extent due to lack of testing. The Trump Administration has completed failed us all and thousands will get sick and many will die due to this incompetence. #CoronavirusPandemic
Seeing #NBA suspend play amid #Coronavirus fears, I took a look at what a delayed or cancelled season would mean for #MLB. TL;DR- player and fan safety comes with a hefty price tag.

No Elmira Maple Syrup festival this year due to #covid19 concerns. The seriousness is hitting home more and more every day. It sucks to be an event organizer right now. #coronavirus
BREAKING: Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, tested positive for the coronavirus. The NBA suspends the rest of the season after player tests positive. Trump announces all travel from Europe suspended.

If #CoronavirusPandemic continues, companies that have embraced remote working for years are going to have a huge advantage over traditional, stodgy companies.
#UKGov has two choices from here: 1) ramp up testing, restrict travel + movement, close schools etc to stop spread of #CoronavirusPandemic 2) or provide economic stimulus to keep fragile Brexit economy ticking - I think they've already chosen 2. Not testing to detect cases either
Between the #NBA suspending play and President #Trump restricting European travel to the US, it's a surreal night of #coronavirus #covid19 news

So the president mistakenly announced a ban on goods from Europe in what was supposed to be an Oval Office address to inform and calm a frantic nation.

I‚Äôll say it again: The White House response to the #COVID19 pandemic has been tragically and dangerously inept.

@RealBFolks @GilCisnerosCA @GOP @GOPLeader In defense of @eugenegu , his careless use was on a day in Jan before we knew there was already a case of #Covid_19 in Washington state (Jan 10) . We were not testing here. Still failing to test and diagnose like we should. Lack of info proves nothing. It will kill ppl, tho.
We‚Äôve decided to self-isolate. Yes we‚Äôre asthmatics with weird immune systems, but mainly because everything outside the house is utterly shitty, at the moment. And if today‚Äôs performance by the cabinet is anything to go by, it‚Äôs about to become dangerously shitty.

@alandrummond2 Hospitals may be overwhelmed. From my layman's perspective, preventing mild #CoVid19 cases from becoming serious is important. There seems to be a lack of detailed guidance for the public on specific home treatments, e.g. whether to use cough suppressants and/or fever reducers.
‚Å¶@WHO‚Å© officially declares #COVID19 a #pandemic.

The worst is yet to come, and  Americans should brace for further disruptions to their daily lives.

‚ÄúWe have got to assume it is going to get worse and worse and worse,‚Äù said Anthony Fauci.

It‚Äôs fun having all your anxiety triggered every day by your worthless government especially because anxiety symptoms like to present as many other possible illnesses.
Awesome.

Don't worry about the deadly pandemic.

Trump assures us the trade will be okay. Even though the UK and South Korea are not on the list. Also, people have to move cargo from Europe. Also, WTF. Also, help.

It‚Äôs time to emphasize getting smart about the #CoronavirusPandemic Educate yourself through the @CDCgov and @WHO websites.
As we work to respond to #COVID19, we must all work to control the spread of germs. This includes using noncontact greetings, staying home if you are sick &amp; washing hands for at least 20 seconds. This is a serious issue that will take us all being vigilant to make a difference. https://t.co/Xiu3xjxWqk

#CoronavirusPandemic America needs to start preparing for when politicians inevitably get sick. As the pandemic gets worse we need people ready to replace the fallen so we can still have leaders during the crisis

#CoronavirusPandemic I really hope this will not bring us to a point where we find ourselves on a moral dilemma of having to choose who to let die. Things are getting double scarier every 6 days. Take care!!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump My friend and her son tested negative at the hospital &amp; were admitted for extremely high fevers, upon release 4 days later their primary care physician tested them as positive for coronavirus. Hospital either made a mistake or the rushed test kits are fake. #CoronavirusPandemic
This is terrible news. Hope @tomhanks and his wife recover soon! Glad Australia has tests and protocol in place.

I am really not sure that people who are so ticked off about sporting events being cancelled due to #COVID19 have considered what missed games mean to stadium employees and club staff. Sports are a diversion,  sure, but they're also the lifeblood of some people.

The president and his administration underestimated this pandemic. Nonetheless, with our vigilant participation, I hope they succeed in their delayed response to prevent the spread of #COVID19 in the U.S.
Don't. Panic. Panic is NOT a remedy or a mitigation strategy. Take serious Coronavirus/ #COVID19. Be more diligent about the same precautions you typically take for the yearly flu and annual cold season. "The World‚Äôs Reaction to the #Wuhan #Coronavirus" - https://t.co/vN0GYgR8df

flu cough? stay home?

snot sneeze? stay...?
@ATLUTD @ClubAmerica Pretty sure @TheChampions needs to suspend the game for #CoronavirusPandemic and replay it from the beginning in a couple of weeks...
I don‚Äôt buy it! If they were truly concerned about reducing the risk of spreading COVID-19 then they would cancel the games. Any player could have it and spread it. It‚Äôs not just the fans that could have it or get it! #thisISstupid #Covid_19 #CoronavirusUSA #WuhanVirus https://t.co/NLoAkIiBQs

@forevertawl Too late for containment now. Time for social distancing to flatten the curve, ie slow down the spread of #covid19 so hospitals aren‚Äôt overwhelmed as it runs its course. Hopefully the arrival of hot and humid weather in much of the country will also slow down the spread.
Conflicted about #Covid_19. We are urged to avoid large gatherings, yet my school alone has nearly 600 people there daily. On the other hand, going virtual if we #CloseTheSchools scares me because it has the potential to perpetuate the achievement gap. I‚Äôm thankful for every day.

To live by the NY epicenter I keep wondering... does anyone care? Does anyone know what to do to protect people? Will anyone lead us with sensible measures? My conclusion: no. We are on our own. #CoronavirusPandemic #NewRochelle #NewYork
#CoronavirusPandemic has people acting stupid. It is an election year and the media has really driven this. Nearly every year there is a new strain of the flu, and corona virus has been around since the 60‚Äôs. Is it possible we‚Äôre being played again? Timing is too perfect.

I wonder if, in a fairly poor future scenario, we‚Äôd achieve herd immunity. Corona virus is a new normal, like the flu, just worse. Corona is to the flu what the flu is to the common cold. Possible, right?

I‚Äôm not a doctor. I just imagine things.

Till now the best and most effective response to #COVID19 is still #China's. Other countries are just treating it as the flu while others decided that no need for panic! Maybe if it weren't for China thousands would have died around the world not knowing the reason!

Are folks thinking the ‚Äúwash your hands‚Äù as a main #COVID19 precaution is suspect? I mean I‚Äôm seeing entire countries be quarantined, European travel banned, soccer games behind closed doors, &amp; NBA suspending the season. There‚Äôs more to this, &amp; even the anti-vaxxers are quiet lol
I hope they cancel opening day. The way some of you are overreacting to that possibility is comical. Sometimes things in life are bigger than a sporting event. And this is one of them! There is a lot of unknown to this and it‚Äôs about the well being of others #CoronavirusPandemic
How #Christians respond during this #CoronavirusPandemic will be vital to how the world views us and our Lord #JesusChrist. May we properly mix safe actions with love and hope, and trust that God will take care of what matters most.

That being said, I do think the #COVID19 is being blown out of proportion by hysteria and media and a government that has no ability handle their tweet-prone president, much less a serious illness of the masses. BUT I'd rather people be over cautious than not enough.
HELP ME! MAKE THIS MAKE SENSE! CORRECT ME!

COVID-19 TODAY:
- 80% will recover
- 20% will... What? Have ongoing respiratory problems or die?
- Expected 70M-100M U.S. cases
- That's 14M-20M with weakened respiratory systems or dead?

I totally agree. Hong Kong acted fast as a result of their bad experience with SARS and I think they have managed to keep their cases down. They closed schools ASAP when they had just a few cases.

Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are not test cases. They may have mild symptoms or severe ones (tho we hope not!) but neither mean that is how the virus affects all people. Continue to get your health info from infectious disease experts. #COVID19 https://t.co/mvIjyOtvMx
So many ppl are going to look stupid after this #CoronavirusPandemic shit turns out to be a flu. 

Trump will remind voters how much the media tried to get our country to implode over this fabricated hysteria.
South Korea's new  #COVID19 numbers are up, and thankfully, the country is only reporting about half as many new cases today (114) as it did yesterday (242). üôè Here's to hoping yesterday was just a blip in a larger declining trend
Many societies tend to irrationally blame groups, like small Jewish communities, in times of crisis.

@davidgokhshtein David, closing borders might be too late now. I think  #Covid19 has already got a foothold in the US and the way forward is to minimize/delay spread by social distancing. The US figures are under-reported due to hardly any testing.
What's worse? 10-15% of the US dying from a virus or...what happens to EVERYONE'S retirement tomorrow at 8:59:59AM? 

Our hubris brought us here. But our fear keeps us here. Let the chips fall where they may, least we allow fear to make this the new normal. #COVID19

Wow a Pandemic #CoronavirusPandemic selfishness and greed led to this, Denying humans the right to eat starving them to where they have to go eats domesticated animals and then we tried to make a profit off of it This virus is karma
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump But that‚Äôs exactly what will happen. Along with incoherent rambling, lies and misrepresentations of the truth. But make no mistake- his nakedly craven effort to downplay the danger of the  #CoronavirusPandemic for political self-interest means there is now blood is on his hands.

@realDonaldTrump Why didn‚Äôt you mention #COVID tests???

Why aren‚Äôt you setting up locations for testing?

Something he has experience in.

#CoronavirusPandemic https://t.co/pe1fpvuvQH
The typical symptoms of  #COVID19  #Coronavirus.  are fever, dry cough, and fatigue, and may also be accompanied by symptoms such as decreased appetite and diarrhea. In severe cases, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing may occur. Most patients have a good prognosis.
This #CoronavirusPandemic got out of control to the point the NBA suspended their whole entire season, Tom Hanks and his wife are tested positive for the virus and NCAA canceled March madness.
I didnt know quarantine and isolation could be so lonely. I haven't hugged my daughter in 6 days. Xanax is my best friend at this point. Sleep is the only solice I have because then at least in my sleep it's like I can socialize.

@RockiWingard @MUSChealth @ChuckTownDaily @WHO I‚Äôm sorry but the scientist disagree you, and state that testing helps determine clusters as well as what further treatment options are necessary. The longer we delay being proactive with this #CoronavirusPandemic the more people will become seriously ill and die.

Any healthy young person who contracts #COVID19 will fight it like the common flu and in two weeks be just fine. The concern is the elderly and people with underlying issues whos immune systems may not sustain.
Panicking,pressure, and thinking of all the things that can go wrong is the way I get thinks done ,relaxing don‚Äôt work for me , it‚Äôs definitely doesn‚Äôt work for a pandemic #CoronaVirusUpdate #pandemic #CoronavirusPandemic #COVID #Survivor #Covid_19

The biggest problem I see with #Covid_19 is that many are infected and don‚Äôt know it because they don‚Äôt have symptoms. You can still spread it even if you‚Äôre not feeling sick. Go through your day as if you are infected and protect others from yourself.
In light of the #CoronavirusPandemic, for the safety of myself and others... 

- Stay calm
- Wash your hands with soap and warm water
- Stay home if you're ill

@Sara_Sawyer_ @Slate Focusing on actionable items for people to slow the transmission of #covid19, giving a sense of control, sounds more to the point to me. Focusing on the mortality rate under optimal conditions, not so much. In the US we are mostly in the dark about how wide-spread the virus is.

Was supposed to fly to Santa Barbara next week. Cancelled my trip today with a heavy heart, knowing it‚Äôs the right thing to do. I‚Äôm not a worrier or a prepper. However, it has become abundantly clear that #covid19 is bigger than all of us. (1/2)
@jennerific713 @realDonaldTrump Everything he said earlier is true. And each of us will vote for who we want... gross assumptions and fortune telling are not threats.

But we can avoid that if we:

* Start engaging in extreme forms of #SocialDistancing
* Radically expand ICU capacities‚Äù

Just to be clear: At best, suspending flights from Europe is completely pointless and a distraction. #covid19 is already in US and spreading widely. At worst, it hampers the fight against #SARSCoV2 by making it even harder to get diagnostic materials (that are in short supply).
Remember not to panic, or care, or feel strong emotions. That's all lame, everything is lame. I'm so cool for not panicking. Imma go listen to The Cure, MCR, and Videotape by Radiohead for a couple of hours after shopping at Hot Topic. I'm too cool for the #CoronavirusPandemic
To all who say not to panic about #COVID19, what do you mean by panic? This is a serious question

Do you mean don't stockpile things? Don't steal hand sanitizers and masks from medical organizations? Things like that?

People, #CoronavirusPandemic is making people with money, take a hit by ‚Äúpausing‚Äù their money making machines... if that‚Äôs not real proof... then yeah, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs serious... go eat more ass
Now that millions/billions/trillions of dollars are at stake due to #CoronavirusPandemic, let's see how fast the private sector gets attacked by the masses as we all realize that there's enough to go around but only . 01% of the population has access to it.
I received a few comments to stop tweeting about #COVID19 and "get back to $crypto." 

1) Watching people in the West take this situation so blas√© I felt it was a moral duty to talk more about this

2) It's all connected regardless, COVID19, the traditional markets, crypto
Please take care of yourself, everyone. Hopefully, this will be over soon and every can enjoy watching a game live once again. #CoronavirusPandemic https://t.co/SFm1v65utA

If you are angry that things are shutting down because of the Coronavirus then you should probably reevaluate your life while you still got time. #CoronavirusPandemic
Big money events like the NBA are suspending all future activities because they have no faith in the Trump Administration's ability to protect us. I am actually surprised to see them willingly give up tremendous amounts of revenue for the sake of society.

There's a non-zero chance I had the #COVID„Éº19 in January. Fever, cough, sniffles (I'm 32). My wife caught it, our cats all got it. Could have been a cold. Could have been this #Coronavirus. #pandemic #CoronaVirusUpdate #CoronavirusPandemic
We were grocery shopping for about 10 minutes before noticing the lines and general fear in the air. We placed all cold things back, had a panic attack, and got Panda Express.

There is an obvious absence of leadership from the top, and as a result it's been fascinating to watch individuals and entities try to deal with #Covid_19 on their own...it's a strange sort of crowdsourced disaster response.
Lowkey gonna laugh when I see all these ‚Äúdamn I lowkey missed the #CoronavirusPandemic ‚Äútweets when all this goes away in a few weeks.
Ya‚Äôll I‚Äôm being real. I‚Äôm not prepared for isolation. We keep about a weeks worth of food/supplies in our house. We have not done the whole ‚Äúfreak-out-shopping‚Äù thing yet. Though I‚Äôm pretty sure we have enough toilet paper for a couple of weeks. Good right? #CoronavirusPandemic

Also, these are tests from the CDC so they could be flawed. We are just hours away from WA. If we independently tested, we would have pandemic #s here too.
@primalpoly This is mostly unnecessary. 

I firmly hold that the fear and panic toward the #CoronavirusPandemic disease has been more harmful than the disease itself, which is perhaps perfectly expectable given its novelty.

However, there is nothing wrong with SENSIBLE precautions. https://t.co/ZWLKXRr2eH

2008 financial crisis is not even comparable with present fall in markets. But no one is willing to call it as financial crisis #CoronavirusPandemic
Isn't it ironic that the anti-science Trump administration is being stopped in its tracks by a virus and science-based testing is critical in fighting the pandemic? Magical thinking doesn't help where viruses are concerned. #CoronavirusPandemic
Trump thinks there's some magic button the Fed can push to fix 40 years of Republican &amp; Democratic led economic decline. This is why YOU CAN'T RUN GOVERNMENT LIKE A CORPORATION!

@KristinKarnitz @WakeboardMom The @NBA is suspending its season because a player tested positive for #covid19.

The World Health Organization has been very careful about using the word pandemic. Now that we have a #CoronavirusPandemic, we need a real leader.

Listen, I know Trump made a speech about #CoronavirusPandemic but the sound of his voice gives me anxiety. Imma cliff notes it on Twitter like it‚Äôs 2004 high school and my life isn‚Äôt on the line. Don‚Äôt let me down.
@Mike_Pence @POTUS if you want to combat covid-19... give everyone a two week staycation. Keep emergency services, grocery stores, and pharmacies open. Add $1,000 to everyone‚Äôs tax returns. Easy peasy problem solved. #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaVirusSolution

@KiranKS Many people say its bad analogy. Still they r not understanding my point. I said care is enough and not the panic. Many people don't know #COVID19 is curable. Even in #chaina death rate is 3%, when it was peak death rate was 3.8%.
@brycetache The timing of this tragedy is mesmerizing. From the time the #ShamTrial ended to the start of the #CoronavirusPandemic leaves no doubt that we are ink on the pages of some parallel beings imagination. That or we just have a dolt for a President.

@sbg1 It's about reducing additional cases coming into the USA, creating additional spread and hardship.
Travel restrictions, social distancing and quarantines are a VITAL public health tool for #COVID19, where we have no vaccine and many serious cases create healthcare burdens.
This coronavirus disease is making me not want to leave my house. I want to quarantine my kids and self. There‚Äôs obviously more ways to get in contact with this and they just haven‚Äôt figured that out yet. #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaVirusUpdate #Corona
It's as simple as this: the entire #CoronavirusPandemic is on the @GOP for not removing the fuck knuckle when they had the chance. Every death, every hardship, every struggle of every American is squarely on them! Their daily failure at not removing him adds to their guilt

Just imagine how undocumented immigrants are handling this #CoronavirusOutbreak . They are likely too scared to go to a hospital out of fear of being reported to ICE. Which means many of them will not get tested‚Äîputting more Americans at risk.

Wild to see Fox News reporting stuff that they mockingly said would never happen a day or two ago (like cancelling of major public events, etc.) while still saying democrats are wildly overreacting and this is basically the same thing as the flu.

I guess I always hoped that, yes - Trump is an incompetent racist, but maybe structures remain in external government agencies (e.g. the CDC) with some level of competence rather than everyone being Trumpian Yes Men. The US response to #Covid19 shows that hope to be a fiction.
Hearing social distancing &amp; readjusting how we do things is key to stemming #covid19 transmission &amp; corporations are limiting non-essential travel, I don‚Äôt  understand why premier @jjhorgan or any premier is flying to Ottawa now.

@exsequar It‚Äôs important, as we distance ourselves physically, to keep the lines of communication open. Humans are social animals. We will go insane if we never talk to someone else. #covid19
I am not being gloomy, just realistic, but for UK, many countries in Europe and the USA it is probably too late to stop the worst case scenario. But we, in New Zealand, still have the opportunity for the best case scenario.  #Covid_19 #NewZealand https://t.co/NGiy3RzDd0
I'm usually very rational, but I'm getting a bit concerned now. I know too many people who might be in the risk category for this damn coronavirus. #Covid_19 #StaySafe
@kylegriffin1 Since we haven‚Äôt done almost any testing in the US, and have more cases than any other European country besides Italy, what is the thought process behind the flight ban? We are the ones doing less than they are...we are lucky they have not banned us. #COVID #COVID19 #TravelBan

@BillBlair Listen Bill.  I know you feel you need to say something on this matter.  But listen.  You really don't! Go read your mandate letter.  #Covid_19 is a health/medical issue.  Not a security/law issue.  It's ok.  Go to bed old guy. Real players are taking care of this game.
I don‚Äôt believe the US has been hit by this as hard as it‚Äôs going to hit us. We‚Äôve just started. A lot more shutdowns and curfews will be implanted. But we are Americans we have unlimited entitlement and freedom so people will continue to spread this. #COVID19

#CoronavirusPandemic it is not time to panic but it is also not time to stay in denial of the consequences and escalating situation. Now is the time for action.
To be honest, this #CoronavirusPandemic is legit scary.... I am starting my new job soon at a restaurant and I am even nervous to start there and interact with people and money.... Its actually insane the amount of places being shut down and sports being suspended
I believe Trump is withholding test kits for #CoronavirusPandemic because if more cases arise he's afraid it'll make him look bad and cause him to not be re elected. I hope I'm wrong.

#Covid_19 cases in US are probably closer to 50,000. People don't know that @CDCgov has been and is refusing to test people. Turns out their initial push to fight #FakeNews was nothing but to close news channels to hide the facts and feed lies to #Americans

3) The average age of the US Senate is about 62 years old. There are 21 (!) senators up for reelection in 2020 over the age of 65. The odds are not negligible that a US senator dies from the #CoronavirusPandemic.  The avg. US House member is  about 58, so they're not invincible.
#CoronavirusPandemic could one of the reasons older people are more at risk for the virus is because they haven‚Äôt received a vaccine younger generations did? Or maybe older people are prone to take a certain medication that typically younger people dont, like HighB or diabetes?
9) Financially, the #CoronavirusPandemic will unfortunately probably most affect those who have the least ability to withstand that stress. Tourism, retail, restaurants, etc. often employ young/minority workers who don't exactly have nest eggs. Many never recovered from 2008-09.
8) For higher education, many colleges and universities are under enormous financial stress. Administrative bloat isn't the only reason - shrinking enrollments are a big factor. Will they view #CoronavirusPandemic-induced distance learning as a long-term cost saving opportunity?

One thing that scares me about the #CoronavirusPandemic is what we do with kids if their parents need hospitalized. We know the kids CARRY the disease, just don't get severe symptoms, so sending them anywhere else risks infecting whoever takes them in. Where do they go?
#CoronavirusPandemic In a large country like ours, only 60 odd cases till date ! Is it under reporting or just that we are more immune to stuff unlike the sanitized countries ? #Hygiene #Immunity #SwachhBharat

Worried that I will bring #CoronavirusPandemic home, and I'll wind up losing my father because of it. While I in my late 20s will probably just be sick for a bit and then bounce back - someone with less than 80% lung capacity won't be so lucky.

The system is fragile. Capitalism is a thin veil. Our governments cannot/choose not to protect us in the ways we need them to. Crazy how so many things are coming to light  because of #COVID #CoronavirusOutbreak
Some pro #CoronavirusPandemic tips you didn't ask for but are getting anyway:
1. Fear isn't an excuse for racism. 
2. Just because you'll probably make it through the illness doesn't mean the immunocompromised people you infect will.
3. For the love of God DON'T DRINK BLEACH.

Ngl, I'm fucking sick of this #Covid_19 paranoia. Licensing bodies in my field have sent out notifications that we might get laid off because people are hoarding masks. That's right, health care personnel might be unable to work because they don't have access to masks. STOP PLZ

Sometimes in pandemics, 
like with #Covid_19 
what is called for the most, 
are mass quarantines.

Staying at home, 
from the virus we hide,
for the first wave to be over, 
we all must abide.

the reason why #COVID19 BECOMES PANDEMIC is dt People say --- "IT'S JUST A FLU, DN'T PANIC".

Y'ALL WNT 'EM to CALM DOWN,but most of d govt worldwide are treating ds virus like a baby to stop people frm panicking.

2. Which makes the prevalence of #Covid_19 longer. It adds burden to the already crumbing resources. People with other conditions can‚Äôt access healthcare when the resources are handling a pandemic. Dying isn‚Äôt the problem here. No one can handle 100,000 sick patients at once..

In America if you have a cough, fever, or difficulty breathing you can be tested for #COVID19. Here in the #Bahamas we are shit out of luck. 200 test kits &amp; they dont want to use them unless you are dying &amp; have likely already spread the virus. I guess.. don't worry be happy mon.

I recognize the seriousness of #Covid_19 but can we please remain calm and level-headed? People are going to be hurt and jobs are going to be lost due to panic.
#Covid_19 declared a pandemic worldwide. I am not scared of death anymore but when after 10-20 years medical students will learn this disease I would proudly say that I was there at this time. (If I am alive üòÇ)
‚ÄúBe calm. There are lots of good things happening.‚Äù - @realDonaldTrump. ..... NBA cancels entire season due to #Covid_19
70-150,000,000 Americans could get the #CoronaVirus. That‚Äôs about 20-40% of the population. Which means up to around 4,500,000 could die. 

But without proper measures being taken, it could be more.

The real problem is that people aren't actually taking the common sense measures required to slow the virus. Washing hands, covering coughs. It doesn't have to be a big deal but it is because people just can't be bothered to care.

#CoronavirusPandemic  Just not the way to respond to a major global health crisis. But then, they do say that "Common sense is not that common". Just wondering if their Government is as clueless as he is. Wasn't it in Boston that at one conference 75 people were infected? https://t.co/7iLyi20IIb

Sad the @NBA is taking the #CoronavirusPandemic serious, but @POTUS thinks it's a hoax. @realDonaldTrump is the ONLY reason why we're so unprepared, why the stocks are crashing and why we will be living like it's the 1920's again. https://t.co/nEXwwc2ZNF

At times like this, I especially encourage everyone to focus on breathing in the negativity and fear and breathing out positivity and possibility. Remain steadfast. #CoronaVirusUpdate #CoronavirusPandemic
Lets make this clear...The problem lies not with the #CoronavirusPandemic in other Nations. @realDonaldTrump can prohibit travel from any country he wants, but that will not stop the spread of the virus within the US. Domestic incubation of the virus is the problem we face.(1/2)
DON'T BREAK YOUR COMPANY'S TRUST IN YOU. With the current sensitive situation brought about by threats of the #COVID19 virus, some companies employ #WorkFromHome arrangement. It means we are to WORK from home. It doesn't mean vacation.
@united is denying my husband a refund for his ticket due to the corona virus. WAKE UP PPL. Their stock has crashed. THEY ARE THIEVES! We want our refund!!!!! #trending #thieves #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaVirusUpdate #BREAKING #unitedairlines
Donald Trump has virtually no #COVID19 tests to offer America (unlike every other country on earth) so he offers racism and xenophobia instead. We don't face a crisis because of China or because of Europe. We face a crisis because Trump paralyzed our response to a global pandemic

#CoronavirusPandemic the problem with the elbow bump is we teach people to cough into their arm not their hand. The ell is risky. Just nod and say hi.
Vulnerable moment: I genuinely am concerned that my workplace will shift us to fully remote soon in wake of all the #Covid19 efforts. I can work from home but I need people and my colleagues and personal interaction. Zoom and Slack don't take the place of that for me.

#NBA just suspended their entire season as a player tests positive for #Covid_19. You can freaking panic now.

While #China a non-democratic country with zero freedom of speech, IS NOT responsible for #Coronavirus, THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE for #CoronavirusPandemic. Had they raised red flags earlier, d outbreak could have been contained. High time the world ends their dependence on China.
